# Discord Bot Overview
Discord Bot Overview
This repository also includes a Discord bot that can coach conversation based on a specified personality. The bot uses a Large Language Model and the v1/chat/completions endpoint to generate creative and high-quality responses with advanced filtering techniques, avoiding repetition and better interacting with users by considering the configured personality and the recent conversation context.
Usage
Please see [USAGE.md](https://github.com/irgolic/AutoPR/blob/main/USAGE.md) for more information on using the AutoPR tool or the Discord bot.

If you'd like to try out GPT-4 AutoPR or the Discord bot, you can make an issue in this repository, and I'll run it manually.
## Personal Experience with AutoPR
I managed to get this thing working with 1 issue and a typo fix (the bot called for a DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN in the usage.md but the actual variable was DISCORD_BOT). Fixing small typo errors like that seems to be a bit tricky unless very specifically guided to solve this. Regardless the actual volume of choices and work it can create is  

When building something in AutoPR the first issue should be detailed and can ask for several different things. In fact asking multiple aspects of a project at once can help the AI understand the direction you are trying to build into so that the choices made will work in the long run. I'm going to try implementing a road-map into my issue requests so the AI can see my long running things I wish to work on. Talking with GPT-4 about file archtiecture beforehand and putting those into the issue can also help focus. 

It also REALLY likes to import things, so if you let it vibe then you will slowly find yourself getting 3-5 copies of the same import. You can either just iteratively feed errors back into the system or actually intelligently code with it as another developer. I'm not that elegent. Had a couple false starts, but rerunning this is enough to get the desired result.
